# HRnet

The last project of my Openclassrooms training course "DÃ©veloppeur front-end React" !! :tada: :tada: :tada:

## Context

Migrating a JQuery library to React.

## Steps

- Creation of the React project and integration according to the models (screenshots of the JQuery project)

- Creation of various components including, as requested in the project specifications, a table (Table), a dropdown menu (DropdownSelect), a modal (Modal) and a date picker (CustomDatePicker).

- Also creation of a search bar, a pagination, a select component allowing to display a certain number of results per page.

- For the date picker, I used the npm library [react-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker)

- I coded all the other features myself.

## Creation and publication of an npm package

I had to create and publish an npm package from one of the components. I chose the Modal.

You can see the package on npm : [hrnet-modal-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hrnet-modal-component)
